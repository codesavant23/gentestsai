Generate the test cases, and associated imports, for ALL classes and ALL functions in the Python module provided.
First generate the code for the test cases WITHOUT ANY IMPORT, then write @@==CODE_END==@@, and ONLY THEN GENERATE THE IMPORTS associated to the test cases written.
When generating the code of test cases you should generate a test class for each class you find, and a test class for all module-proper functions.
YOU MUST NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE CODE GIVEN TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL.
The module given is called "{@Module_Name@}" and belongs to a project called "{@Proj_Name@}".
The code of the module follows the empty line after this line, and it will end with @@==PROMPT_END==@@ (excluded)

{@Focal_Code@}
