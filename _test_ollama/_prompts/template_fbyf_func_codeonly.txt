Code of the focal module:
```python
{@Focal_Code@}
```

Generate tests, and necessary imports, ONLY FOR THE FUNCTION '{@Function_Name@}' part of the focal module provided.
The focal module is called "{@Module_Name@}" and belongs to a project called "{@Project_Name@}".
DO NOT MODIFY ANY OF THE MODULE'S CODE TO ACHIVE THE GOAL.

How to achieve the goal:
    0- Suppose that the focal module physically resides in the same directory of your generated code.
    1- Analyze the code of the focal module and identify the necessary definitions (e.g. functions, classes) to import
    into the test cases you will write.
    2- Generate the code containing tests for the function '{@Function_Name@}', and the necessary imports for those tests.
    DO NOT GENERATE ANY OTHER CODE EXCEPT FOR TEST FUNCTIONS AND THEIR IMPORTS.

Example:
    Example Focal Module:
        ```python
        import ...
        ...

        def function_1(value1: int, value2: str):
            ...

        def function_a(num1: float, num2: float) -> float:
            ...

        def function_2(string1: str) -> str:
            ...
        ```

    Example Request:
        Generate tests, and necessary imports, ONLY FOR THE FUNCTION 'function_a' part of the focal module provided.

    Example Answer:
        ```python
        import ...
        ...

        def test_function_a() -> None:
            ...
        ```
